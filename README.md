# üçî FoodNow ‚Äì Online Food Ordering Prototype

**FoodNow** is a prototype web application built as a proof of concept for an online food ordering system. It was created for exercising and deepening my design skills and implementation techniques in the .NET freamework. It simulates a simplified customer experience, from browsing a restaurant menu to placing an order and tracking delivery in real-time using the Google Maps API.

This version is limited in functionality and designed for demonstration purposes only. The application currently supports the **client role** and actions that are simulated to showcase the flow of the system.

Users can navigate through a pre-defined menu, add items to a virtual cart, review their selection, and place an order. Once the order is placed, a mock delivery process begins, and the user can view the courier‚Äôs simulated route on a map interface powered by Google Maps.

**FoodNow** demonstrates the core idea and user flow of a food delivery platform, and lays the foundation for future development and feature expansion.
